# Poleâœ­ (Polestar) -- Alpha

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vega/polestar.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vega/polestar)

PoleStar is Tableau-style User Interface for visual analysis, building on top
of [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite). Try our [online
demo](http://vega.github.io/polestar/). Also, be sure to check our [related
projects](https://vega.github.io/).

**This project is an [alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha) software.
We are working on improving its code and documentation.**

If you are using Polestar for your project(s), please let us know what are you using it for by emailing us at [Vega-Lite \[at\] cs.washington.edu](mailto:vega-lite@cs.washington.edu).  Feedbacks are also welcomed.
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [create an issue](https://github.com/vega/polestar/issues/new).


## Team

Polestar's development is led by Dominik Moritz, Kanit Wongsuphasawat, and Jeffrey Heer at the University of Washington [Interactive Data Lab](http://idl.cs.washington.edu), in collaboration with [UW eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) and [Tableau Research](http://research.tableau.com)

## Setup Instruction

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have node.js. (We recommend using [homebrew](http://brew.sh) and simply run `brew install node`.)

`cd` into your local clone of the repository, and install all the npm and bower dependencies (bower will auto-run when npm finishes):

```sh
cd polestar
npm install
```

Now you should have all dependencies and should be ready to work.

### Running

You can run `npm start`, which serves the site as well as running tests in the background.
If you edit any file, our [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) task runner should automatically refresh the browser and re-run tests.

To execute other tasks, either use the npm script aliases `npm run lint`, `npm test`, or `npm run build`, or else install gulp globally with `npm install -g gulp` and run the tasks directly from gulp.

## Development Guide

### Folder Structure

We try to follow [Google's Angular Best Practice for Angular App Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub) and use [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) to setup the project.

All source code are under `src/`

- `src/app/` contains our main classes
- `src/components` contains our other components
- `src/assets/images/` contains relevant images
- `src/data/` contains all data that we use in the application
- `src/vendor` contains

@kanitw created [`gulp/gen.js`](https://github.com/vega/polestar/blob/master/gulp/gen.js) for help generating angular components.
For example, you can run `gulp gen -d directiveName` and this would create all relevant files including the javascript file, the template file, the stylesheet file and the test spec.

#### Coding Style

We use jshint as our linter for coding in the project.

#### Stylesheets

We use [sass](http://sass-lang.com) as it is a better syntax for css.

#### Dependencies

Managing front-end dependencies with [Bower](http://bower.io) requires the `bower` package to be globally installed:
```sh
npm install -g bower
```

This project depends on [Datalib](https://github.com/vega/datalib) for data processing, [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite) as a formal model for visualization, and [Vega-Lite-ui](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-ui), which contains shared components between Polestar and Voyager.

If you plan to make changes to these dependencies and observe the changes without publishing / copying compiled libraries all the time, use [`bower link`](https://oncletom.io/2013/live-development-bower-component/).

In each of your dependency repository, run

```sh
cd path/to/dependency-repo
bower link
```

Then go to this project's directory and run

```sh
bower link datalib
bower link vega-lite
bower link vega-lite-ui
```

Now all the changes you make in each repo will be reflected in your Vega-Lite automatically.

Since bower uses the compiled main file, make sure that each repos is compiled everytime you run `npm start`.
Otherwise, you will get errors for missing libraries.

### Releasing / Github Pages

`gh-pages` branch is for releasing a stable version.
`gh-pages` should only contain the dist folder.

Use `publish.sh` to:

1. publish the current version to npm
2. deploy the current branch to gh-pages and
3. create a release tag for github and bower.

We used [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) for bootstraping our project.
